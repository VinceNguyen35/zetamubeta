		<h3>Alpha Chapter History</h3>
		<p>Believe it or not, racial discrimination still occurs in our world today.</p>
		<p>A large amount of people still fight one another due to skin color, ethnic background, and/or religion, but to a certain group of individuals, none of this mattered.</p>
		<p>This group of individuals cared for each other and loved one another through thick and thin, regardless of race or religion.</p>
		<p>No one was treated differently from the other; White, Black, Asian, or Hispanic, everyone was equal.</p>
		<p>At a time of racial and gang warfare, one of its most beloved brothers, Fred Gonzalez, was shot and killed.</p>
		<p>This incident brought both sadness and anger upon the group's brothers, but they couldn't let this bring them down.</p>
		<p>They took this loss as an opportunity to reach out to others and bring the word of Zeta Mu Beta out.</p>
		<p>From this, a goal was developed. This goal was to demonstrate unification amongst one another and to the future and oncoming members.</p>
