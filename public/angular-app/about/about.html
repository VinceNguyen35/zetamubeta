		<h3>Alpha Chapter History</h3>
		<p>Racial prejudice and discrimination has been rampant in our society for hundreds of years. Even in today’s modern world, people are persecuted, terrorized, and discriminated against because of their race, religion, and sexual orientation. To tackle this issue, a group of brothers came together to create a place where no brother would be treated unequally due to the color of their skin, or the God they worship. This brotherhood would identify, accept, and embrace all of their brother’s differences and push them to become the best versions of themselves that they could be. At a time of heightened racial tensions and gang warfare in Long Beach, an innocent man and one of the group’s most beloved brothers, Fred Gonzalez, was killed due to his race. In his honor, this group of brothers brought Zeta Mu Beta into the world. Their goal was to use this tragic incident as an opportunity to educate the young men of Long Beach to accept their differences and to accept the differences of others. These differences are what make us unique, they are what makes us great. By doing so, they aim to create a brighter future for the rest of the world.</p>

We strive to create a platform for our brothers to display their unique ethnic cultures, religions, and everyday passions. In addition to their professional and educational development, we wish for our members to develop their hobbies and passions, as that is what makes them unique. By doing so, we can unify our members through their differences to create a more socially understanding brotherhood and community.</p>
